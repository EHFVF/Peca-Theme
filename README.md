## Why is theme free?
Hahaha! Good question guys, well there are bundles of reasons why this theme is free:
- I want everybody to use this theme.
- I'm still young for online businesses.
- I don't have the requirements like the cards, I don't know what kind of cards but I know It's a card, maybe it's a playing card, just kidding.
- I'm contented of what I got.
- I wanted to be famous.
- To meet new friends.

## Found a bug or want to recommend something?
[Send me an email](http://phoenixpeca.ga/contact) and I'll try fix it for you (IF I CAN), or you can fix it for me by attaching a patch and tell me why should I apply it. I can't fix everything, because I am still new to kirby and I still have limited PHP knowledge. Please note that I only accept Peca Theme's bug (FOR BUGS RELATED TO KIRBY ITSELF, NOT THE THEME, REPORT IT TO BASTIAN ALLGEIER).
