Peca Theme is an awesome theme for Kirby, a file-based CMS. This theme  was equipped with great features and smart functions. It was optimized for mobile phones, search-engines, social-networking sites, and users of course for best experience.

## Who are you?
Hi! I am Phoenix Eve Aspacio. I am 14 yrs old. I live in the Philippines. I live in Maslog, Sibulan, Negros Oriental.

## Why is this theme free?
Hahaha! Good question guys, well there are bundles of reasons why this theme is free:
- I want everybody to use this theme.
- I'm still young for online businesses.
- I don't have the requirements like the cards, I don't know what kind of cards but I know It's a card, maybe it's a playing card, just kidding.
- I'm contented of what I got.
- I wanted to be famous. (link: https://twitter.com/PhoenixPeca text: Follow me on twitter).
- To meet new friends. (link: https://www.facebook.com/phoenix.aspacio text: Add me as a friend).

## Is this theme open source?
Maybe, I mean you can modify it as much as you want for your own personal/company use, but you can never acknowledge that this theme is yours nor redistribute or resell it.

## Found a bug or want to recommend something?
(link: /contact text: Send me an email) and I'll try fix it for you, or you can fix it for me by attaching a patch and tell me why should I apply it. Please note that I can't fix everything, because I am still new to kirby and I have limited PHP knowledge and I only accept Peca Theme's bug (FOR BUGS RELATED TO KIRBY ITSELF, NOT THE THEME, REPORT IT TO (link: http://getkirby.com/support text: BASTIAN ALLEIER popup: yes)).
